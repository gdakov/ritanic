Contribution may be welcome. Preferably finding bugs, or implementing missing
stuff.
New features not already present are unlikely to be accepted in the basic core.
Code can be rejected on the basis of too much delay of the circuit or too large size of the circuit.
I don't guarantee to share the income from the commercial licensing with external
contributors but if someone contributes, they should accept that i can offer the core
with their code under the commercial license as well as the gpl v3.

In general, assume MUX circuits are with enable signals and not with an index.
