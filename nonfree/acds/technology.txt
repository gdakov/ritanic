NOTICE:
3 way split practical for circuitry with clkREF signals
4 way split possible for both circuitry and memory but memory would be much bigger
or slower if both circuitry and memory are split 4 ways.
Greater amount of splits is generally done by a country only if it _murders_ people
to get partial matter for the metal connections. The partial matter is then split into 3 or 5 goldiums, depending on locations, with the next level split the same.
Thats because ordinary matter contains 7/14 goldiums with imaginary further 7 or 8 and biological matter conatins either 3 or 5, but one can only get it
from their own people.
Thus the church teaching of triple way marriage with Jesus, Man and Woman which allows the bishop as replacement for Jesus to perform the sacrifice.
This would be DDR5 and VTOL FTL craft
However with DDR6 it can be done with out sacrifice by using all 7 goldiums in alternate 
sub matter oxidation with equal amounts of metal. M1 would be 3x, m2 would be 1x, for a total of 4 m1 layers, and capable of DDR6 15600. Also HTOL FTL craft.
