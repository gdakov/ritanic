according to me there is no ghost in a machine style soul.
AND this cpu in goldium/inraloka level aka sensors also driven by goldium with em radiation and an iraloka power tower or EM receiver to power it, the following features are needed
to implement brain emulation cpu:
1. Cut bounds checking - might introduce back spectre flaw(s)
2. increase VM to 56 bit
3. implement 100x - 120x hardware compression for the connectome to be adressable as swappable pages.
4. Implemet 128 bit 16 bit gather/scatter with 5 bit parcels individually shifted by 1,15, and 30 bits into the index transparently - results in return of pseudo dual domain register, same IPC. use multiplier of 0 to select it.

DUAL gold gates gate bodies and cables required and dual gold sensors but gold 1 and 2 all 7 types can be made without human sacrifice using clkref singnal oxidation.
within the lvl two gold signal wires and gates, there is 7 lvl one gold and 24 level 2 gold inraloka sub-split signals.
128 TB per chip, 15 million gflops 64 bit, three chips for each brain

SELF REVIEW

1. if using one extra bit per 16 rather than 64, which still leaves enough room for ECC with 2048 bit cacheline for memory block with 2 bit ECC per byte, it is possible to return bounds checking of 2 bit significant, and 6 bit exponent, which allows for some spectre flaw protection but not necesarily for ROP return and or out-out-bounds access as out of bound access protection will have average wastage of 12.5%. On the other hand, if the user desires the bounds checking quite a lot, it is possible. NOTE: the large wastage only applies to small objects; large objects can be padded with unallocated pages
2. Transparent in-ram paging has to be implemented for one or two mappings per page, to eliminate random access page fault for brain emulation as that would considerably slow it down.
review 2
6 out of 7 lol 1 gold signals can be sent. 21 lol 2 gold and 35 level 3 gold for 3 copies of each ram bit gives about 41 bits given the 3 instead of 2 cells. core split 27 ways with two copies offset by 6 phases very low radiation and 54 vector with 50 simultaneous insert from ram and enough store recycle.
SELF REVIEW
NEURONS will have to be together with dendrites about 25 trillion due to close to firing field of 300000 rather than comfortably not firing filed of 100000, which makes them about 3 microns in size given 300 i/o.
This assumes that the 60mv potential of nerves is not fabricated.
Therefore 10 chips rather than 3 are required. They can be connected by drill through rods or capacitive coupling or coil coupling.
